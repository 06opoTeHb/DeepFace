# DeepFace

Open source implementation of the renowned publication titled ["DeepFace: Closing the Gap to Human-Level Performance in Face Verification"](https://research.fb.com/publications/deepface-closing-the-gap-to-human-level-performance-in-face-verification/) by Yaniv Taigman, Ming Yang, Marc'Aurelio Ranzato, Lior Wolf published at Conference on [Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/menu.py) 2014.

The proposed CNN architecture in the paper have been implemented using Keras ([tf.keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras)) and have been trained on Cloud TPUs.
